Use tabular coding standards for proper function calling. We can use Visual code for best coding structure.

If we are using one variable at some places with same name make sure that variables values are not going to be changed.
Use unique name for variable at same page.
Use minimal join queries for fetching data if more than 3 tables join needs specifically in pagination.
Use helpers for using more than one time function use is happening.
Use migrations for creating tables in database. 
Do not use any live CDN in projects. Download and use where it needs.
Use comments for defining any function and before we modify any existing code.
